In particular, you will use the VNP46A1 to detect differences in night lights before and after the storm to identify areas that lost electric power.\n\nTo determine the number of homes that lost power, you link (spatially join) these areas with [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84) data on buildings and roads.\n\nTo investigate potential socioeconomic factors that influenced recovery, you will link your analysis with data from the US Census Bureau.\n\n##### Learning objectives:\n\n-   load vector/raster data\\\n-   simple raster operations\\\n-   simple vector operations\\\n-   spatial joins\n\n### Data\n\n#### Night lights\n\nUse NASA's Worldview to explore the data around the day of the storm. There are several days with too much cloud cover to be useful, but 2021-02-07 and 2021-02-16 provide two clear, contrasting images to visualize the extent of the power outage in Texas.\n\nVIIRS data is distributed through NASA's [Level-1 and Atmospheric Archive & Distribution System Distributed Active Archive Center (LAADS DAAC)](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/). Many NASA Earth data products are distributed in 10x10 degree tiles in sinusoidal equal-area projection. Tiles are identified by their horizontal and vertical position in the grid. Houston lies on the border of tiles h08v05 and h08v06. We therefore need to download two tiles per date.\n\nAs you're learning in EDS 220, accessing, downloading, and preparing remote sensing data is a skill in it's own right! To prevent this assignment from being a large data wrangling challenge, we have downloaded and prepped the following files for you to work with, stored in the `VNP46A1` folder.\\\n\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v05.001.2021039064328.h5.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-07\\\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021038.h08v06.001.2021039064329.h5.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-07\\\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v05.001.2021048091106.h5.tif`: tile h08v05, collected on 2021-02-16\\\n-   `VNP46A1.A2021047.h08v06.001.2021048091105.h5.tif`: tile h08v06, collected on 2021-02-16\n\n#### Roads\n\nTypically highways account for a large portion of the night lights observable from space (see Google's [Earth at Night](https://earth.google.com/web/@27.44405464,-84.7693044,206.63660162a,8916361.52264659d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CiQSIhIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTc)). To minimize falsely identifying areas with reduced traffic as areas without power, we will ignore areas near highways.\n\n[OpenStreetMap (OSM)](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/) is a collaborative project which creates publicly available geographic data of the world. Ingesting this data into a database where it can be subsetted and processed is a large undertaking. Fortunately, third party companies redistribute OSM data. We used [Geofabrik's download sites](https://download.geofabrik.de/) to retrieve a shapefile of all highways in Texas and prepared a Geopackage (`.gpkg` file) containing just the subset of roads that intersect the Houston metropolitan area.Â \n\n-   `gis_osm_roads_free_1.gpkg`\n\n#### Houses\n\nWe can also obtain building data from OpenStreetMap. We again downloaded from Geofabrick and prepared a GeoPackage containing only houses in the Houston metropolitan area.\\\n\n-   `gis_osm_buildings_a_free_1.gpkg`\n\n#### Socioeconomic\n\nWe cannot readily get socioeconomic information for every home, so instead we obtained data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs) for census tracts in 2019. The *folder* `ACS_2019_5YR_TRACT_48.gdb` is an ArcGIS [\"file geodatabase\"](https://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/manage-data/administer-file-gdbs/file-geodatabases.htm), a multi-file proprietary format that's roughly analogous to a GeoPackage file.\\\n\nYou can use `st_layers()` to explore the contents of the geodatabase. Each layer contains a subset of the fields documents in the [ACS metadata](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/tiger/prejoined/ACSMetadata2011.txt).\\\n\nThe geodatabase contains a layer holding the geometry information, separate from the layers holding the ACS attributes. You have to combine the geometry with the attributes to get a feature layer that `sf` can use.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(sf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nLinking to GEOS 3.10.2, GDAL 3.4.2, PROJ 8.2.1;

study\n\nUpon looking at the maps and boxplot I made above, there does not seem to be a very significant difference in the median income between the two groups: those affected by the blackout and those not affected. That really surprised me because I believe that the electrical infrastructure in lower income neighborhoods would have likely been older and more subject to failure while the grid was in a stressful state during this weather event. I would say that a limitation to this study is the fact that the two satellite images that we started with happened to be a bit far apart temporally. I would hypothesize that if we were able to obtain a photo right before the blackout happened, and then right when the blackout was at its most severe, we would have been able to see a larger difference, and possibly seen more significant results. Additionally, the data may have been slightly misleading for the income data because the areas farther from the city seemed to be much less affected, and likely contain very different demographics than those closer to the urban areas of Houston. I noticed that the more rural areas tended to have slightly lower median incomes. It would be interesting to focus on a smaller area, because these large tracts may have skewed our data a bit.\n",
